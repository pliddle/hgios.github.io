        "what_text": "\"The Ambassadors programme started around 2018. Discussions around every day leadership and the meaning of leadership roles led the school to make a bold change: the removal of captain roles, replaced by \"\"ambassador\"\" roles. Over time these roles have matched into the work of departments and areas of the school. The roles have evolved to meet the needs of young people in the school with ambassadors focus on support for learning, wellbeing, extra-curricular opportunities, transition, digital skills, and many other areas of practice.\n\nThe work of Ambassador development started when a small group of pupils attended East Dunbartonshire Council training on Augmented and Alternative Communication. The effect on the young people was profound - one young person changed their UCAS application in order to focus on Educational Psychology rather than their original Science-based pathway. Two of the team had applied for captaincy roles and had been unsuccessful - an indication, perhaps, that the system wasn't reflecting the value of the work.\n\nOver the following years, pupils and staff identified roles, invented new roles, and were awarded badges to recognise their place in the leadership of the schools. Ambassadors have contributed to the school in a multitude of ways, including:\n\n- Event planning and organising - discos, proms, charity events.\n- Supporting young people in class on a one to one and whole class level\n- Visiting and working with young people in primary school through digital learning, sports, reading and languages\n- Supporting wellbeing through wellbeing focused clubs, and highlighting positive mental health strategies through assemblies\n- Led the development of a charities committee that reflects the views and supportive actions of the community \n- Represented the school at events and organised teams to support young people at events\n- Run extra curricular opportunities including sports coaching, science and engineering clubs\n- Supported staff and pupils as digital ambassadors with online homework tools and Glow, including supporting parents\n- Supporting the school library\n- Supporting language development in class and with individual pupils\n- Supporting Young Enterprise competitions and events in school\n\nA particular achievement has been the impactful work of peer mentor support in Mathematics and Chemistry, where young people support students in the years below to study - in the form of classroom support and interventions.\"",

In 2020, the model of meeting and developing improvement priorities was difficult to continue with as the school moved to a recovery plan for 2020-2021. Following this, the Senior Leadership Team consulted with staff over a variety of exercises to gauge opinions of moving forward with improvement and leading on improvement. This involved mapping time into the Working Time Agreement to support meeting time, and providing a structure for improvement. \n[pdf: BA Improvement Team Book.pdf]\nThe tools for improvement have evolved over time, and have looked at cycles of improvement, focus on equity and impact, and setting realistic targets. Evidence shows use of improvement cycle methodologies in 2022, 2023 and 2024, using teams of teaching staff to develop and plan actions based on priorities in the improvement plan.\n\nThrough the leadership shown across many groups, the school has managed to link staff improvement teams to pupil improvement teams, with leads liaising between the two groups. This has allowed pupils to negotiate the direction of travel, advise, and provide their own ideas for improvement, whilst also understanding how school priorities may be have a wider focus.\nThe management of the groups has been responsive: where time has not been available to meet due to other pressures, we have adjusted planning. In the 2025 session, we focused on making action plans per improvement priority. This meant groupings changed, but were focused strongly on the work to generate improvement versus the plan. \nThe school also uses PEF to create temporary leadership roles to support elements of improvement – this has included, over time, Wider Achievement, STEM Nation, Digital Learning, Creativity and Outdoor Learning.",

Bearsden Academy recognised the significant impact the Covid -19 pandemic had on young people’s emotional wellbeing, social development, and learning confidence. In response, we made a deliberate and strategic decision to place nurture and equity at the heart of our recovery planning and intervention design.  \n\nStrengths in Practice:\n\n• Senior Phase Triage: SLT, PT Guidance and PT Curricular staff identify pupils requiring targeted input, and allocate appropriate support. Interventions may include mentoring, small group support, well-being interventions and personalised curriculum decisions.\n• Pupil Led Interventions:\n• Enhanced Transition Pathways: Targeted transition support is in place for pupils with ASN, EAL, care experience, or wider vulnerabilities. Individualised transition plans are co-constructed with families, primaries, and partner agencies. Feedback from pupils and parents evidences increased confidence, reduced anxiety, and improved engagement in S1.\n• In-School Intervention Planning: Departments regularly review data to identify pupils requiring intervention and implement subject-specific supports (e.g. supported study, targeted group work, scaffolding of assessments). Departmental tracking data is collated monthly to inform a whole-school overview.\n• Pupil Voice and Participation: Learners are actively involved in the planning and review of their support, through coaching conversations, pupil support meetings, and pastoral planning. This ensures interventions are not only inclusive but also empowering and learner-led.\n• Deployment of Pupil Equity Funding (PEF) to support tailored interventions in ESOL, Digital Learning, Wider Achievement, and engagement.\n\n• Early Identification and Targeted Support: A range of quantitative and qualitative data (attainment tracking, wellbeing indicators, attendance, SIMD/FSM, ASN profiles, and teacher insight) is used to identify pupils requiring additional support.

Additionally, the school adds further value versus the Virtual Comparator when compared to schools with similar levels of attainment and similar VC values (e.g. Williamwood High school, Mearns Castle).\nPresentation policy has been adapted over the last 8 years from a focus on level change (e.g. National 5 to National 5) to additionally (e.g. potential of delivery of units, or National 4)  to intervention focused work (identifying multiple approaches to deliver a pass). \n\nThe process also changed from a paper-based “level change” procedure to a collegiate discussion focus. Principal Teachers meet with a lead Senior Leader to discuss progress of all learners at risk of underperforming.
